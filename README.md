# Actigraphy-Example
Here, you can find an R markdown file as well as an html document (within the docs folder) containing code pertaining to a project looking at actigraph-measured physical activity across age and pubertal development. This is done while controlling for weight-for age percentile, race/ethnicity, CIS impairment, psychiatric diagnoses (having depression or not), and sex. One-spline regression modeling is used, and a plot is shown. 

The link to viewing the html document outputted from this code is attached:
